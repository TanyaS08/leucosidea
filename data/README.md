# Datasets for GGHNP

datasets (briefly) described below

`FT.txt`: Functional trait data. Note the 'plots' do not coincide with the other datasets as the data were collected in 2018. That being said the sites do correspond so site A refers to the same general location for both the 2017 and 2018 data. Additionally this was only for seven (I think) common species.

`microclimate.txt`: This can be viewed as the site/plot metadata in a way. Here there is information about the microclimate (air and soil temperature, soil moisture) as well as more data about the 'target' *Leucosidea* individual and distance to nearest neighbours (collected 2017)

`spp_richness.txt`: Species cover (and by default richness) for each plot (collected 2017)

> :warning: I'm not 100% convinced on the providence for the below dataset... will re-collate and possibly integrate into the microclimate dataset...

`richness_cover_forb_grass.txt`: The summed richness and cover for forbs and grasses
