## Repo organisation

This repository is contained in an Rproject and should be used as such (this is done by opening the .Rproj folder in RStudio). The scripts are contained in `scripts/` and are numbered sequentially based in the order within the methods in the manuscript. Any figures that are generated will be written to `figures/` and data tables to `outputs/`, with the necessary data contained in `data/`.
